There are no issues with the attached code, because we had a lot of time to debug and solve any problems we had. We had some problems initially with understanding project 0 - which was the base of our project 1 code. The recursive client functionality was key to the design of our project. Because of the recursive client functionality, the client was able to make queries to the RS server to check if it had the IP address of the machine. If not, the client would then query the TS server instead. Finally, the client would throw an error if it was in neither of the servers.

We never coded in python before so understanding the code was a little difficult, however, after few days of learning python syntax and understanding the concepts in python we were able to understand project 0 and then develop ideas on how to design project 1. We thought that file manipulation was going to be very difficult as we only coded in Java and C before and didn’t know how easy python makes file reading and writing. The split function especially was very useful in reading and writing to files. Due to project 0 we knew how to create a socket and initiate connection between client and server, which helped a lot in project 1. Furthermore, we had confusion on little stuff like whether we should use only the information provided in the DNS tables and print hostname not found or have to do a lookup; however, Piazza was useful as other students asked similar questions and the answer was given by the professor within hours.

Out of all the lessons we learned throughout this project, two were the most important. First, we got to learn about socket programming in python which we did not have a lot of experience with previously. This should be very helpful as python is a very dynamic language as there are many applications for it. Additionally, we got to learn about how DNS server lookups and queries work.
